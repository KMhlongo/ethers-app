# EthersApp

** This is intended to run alongside the ethers-service application which serves as a backend **

Instructions to run this Angular Application

Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The baseUrl for API calls is defined in src/app/services/ethers.service.ts. Change this to match the url of your ethers-service nest application.
